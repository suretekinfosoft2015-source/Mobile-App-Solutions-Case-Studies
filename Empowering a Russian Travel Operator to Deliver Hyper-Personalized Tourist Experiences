Client Profile
Our client is a leading cultural travel operator in Russia, renowned for crafting immersive tours that seamlessly blend history, cuisine, and local experiences. Operating since the early 2000s, they have built a reputation for authentic journeys but realized that today’s travelers expect more than guidebooks or generic mobile apps. To stay competitive, they aimed to embrace digital transformation and deliver real-time, hyper-personalized travel experiences.

Business Challenge
Traditional tourism apps often lack real-time personalization and contextual insights, leaving tourists with generic recommendations. With global travel platforms entering the market, the client needed to stand out by:

Delivering AI-driven, location-based recommendations
Sending real-time push alerts with curated offers
Unlocking new revenue streams via advertiser partnerships
Ensuring seamless cross-platform accessibility (Web, iOS & Android)
The vision: a modern smart travel assistant that dynamically engages tourists while enabling local businesses to connect with them at the right place and time.
